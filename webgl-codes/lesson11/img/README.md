In this folder, only the size of moon.gif is a power of 2.

If you want to change those image size,

go to http://www.pictureresize.org/online-images-converter.html to resize the image...

Also the WebGL inspector http://benvanik.github.com/WebGL-Inspector/ can help to check the image which can be screwed or isn't loading...
